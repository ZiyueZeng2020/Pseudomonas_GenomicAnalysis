### Realpath of this file: sbatch /home/zzeng/git_hub/scripts/pseudomonasAnalysis/ExtractFastaBasedOnCoordinates.sh ###

### Requirement of bed file:
### Column 1 (fasata name) matches the FASTA header.
### Column 2 (start) is 0-based (you subtracted 1 from the original start). So the start need to be manually reduced by 1
### Tab-separated. The bed file can be made in Excel and saved as txt (sep by tab). And renamed as .bed
### Headers of each extracted fasta in column 4.

### Check before running the script.......
head -n 1 $BEDFILE | cat -A ### Prints the first line and "cat -A" shows all normally-invisible characters: tabs appear as ^I, line-ends as $, carriage returns as ^M, non-ASCII bytes as M-â€¦, etc.
